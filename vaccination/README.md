# Roadmap / to-do list

- [X] 2-cohort code with fixed-point iteration
- [ ] Extend to include exposed, asymptomatic, etc.
- [ ] Extend to N cohorts
- [ ] Extend to multiple regions
- [ ] Some test in which iteration makes a difference
- [ ] Incorporate economic factors
- [ ] Deal more precisely with positivity constraint
- [ ] Deal with situation in which multiple groups should be dosed on a single timestep (perhaps unnecessary if the timestep is kept small enough)
